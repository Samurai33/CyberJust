# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The CyberJustice Brasil team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them through one of the following methods:

#### üîí Preferred Method: Email
- **Email**: [security@cyberjustice.com](mailto:security@cyberjustice.com)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability`
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 24 hours

#### üìù Required Information

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
2. **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the vulnerability
3. **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
5. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
6. **Impact assessment** - what an attacker might be able to achieve
7. **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue

#### üîê PGP Encryption (Optional)

For highly sensitive reports, you may encrypt your message using our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key will be published separately]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## üö® Vulnerability Response Process

### Timeline

1. **Initial Response**: 24 hours
2. **Triage and Assessment**: 72 hours
3. **Fix Development**: Varies based on complexity
4. **Security Advisory**: After fix is deployed
5. **Public Disclosure**: 90 days after initial report (or when fix is available)

### Process Steps

1. **Acknowledgment**: We confirm receipt and assign a tracking ID
2. **Investigation**: Our security team investigates the vulnerability
3. **Verification**: We verify and assess the impact
4. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
5. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with you on disclosure timeline
6. **Release**: We deploy the fix and publish security advisory

## üèÜ Security Bug Bounty

While we don't currently offer monetary rewards, we provide:

- **Public acknowledgment** in our security hall of fame
- **Contributor recognition** in project documentation
- **Direct communication** with our security team
- **Early access** to security-related features

### Scope

#### ‚úÖ In Scope
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Data validation and sanitization issues
- Session management vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Information disclosure
- Business logic vulnerabilities

#### ‚ùå Out of Scope
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security issues
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services
- Issues in development/staging environments
- Vulnerabilities requiring physical access
- Automated scanner reports without manual verification

## üîê Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

- **Authentication**: Secure login system with session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Security Headers**: HTTPS, CSP, HSTS implementation
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits and updates
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring

### Security Best Practices

#### For Contributors
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use security-focused linting rules
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Write security-focused tests
- Use TypeScript for type safety

#### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication (when available)
- Keep your browser updated
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Use HTTPS connections only
